# Project 1: Elementary Logic Gates
# Fengshi Teng â€“ October 6, 2024

# Description

This project focuses on creating elementary logic gates using an online hardware simulation IDE. The goal is to construct 15 basic gates, all derived from a given NAND gate. This project provides a clear demonstration of the fundamental building blocks of a chip.

# Progress

I successfully implemented 15 gates in HDL, and all of them function correctly within the NAND2Tetris online IDE.
